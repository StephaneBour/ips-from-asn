![Daily Update](https://github.com/StephaneBour/ips-from-asn/workflows/Daily%20Update/badge.svg)

The goal of this project is to provide a range list of known datacenter IPs in order to blacklist them in your applications.

The [release file](https://github.com/StephaneBour/ips-from-asn/releases/latest/download/release.zip) contains 2 text files, with the IP ranges in IPv4 and IPv6.

If you want specific ASN IP ranges, you can edit the file asn-blacklist.txt and run asn-blacklist.txt


#### Automatic updates

Every day, at midnight, a check is made to update the default list.
